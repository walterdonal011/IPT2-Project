# Comment System Implementation - Update Log

## 📅 Date: Today's Session (Incremental Update)

This document lists all files modified during the implementation of the Facebook-like comment system.

---

## 📁 Files Modified Today (This Session)

### 1. **UPDATED: `src/services/CommentService.js`**
- **Status:** Enhanced
- **Key Changes Today:**
  - Display full names for comments and replies by enriching snapshot data with `users/{uid}` profile:
    - Added `getUserProfile(uid)` and `getUserDisplayName(uid)` helpers (used for create + listeners).
    - `listenToComments` and `listenToReplies` now map each item to `displayName = firstName + ' ' + lastName` (fallback: `displayName` → `email`).
  - Kept sorting on client while avoiding Firestore composite index requirement.
  - Removed debug `console.log` statements from listeners for better performance.
  - Kept reaction endpoints intact; no schema changes.

### 2. **MODIFIED: `src/services/PostService.js`**
- No functional changes today (left as-is). Listed for context with the reaction system.

### 3. **MODIFIED: `src/components/ui/posts/PostCard.vue`**
- **Status:** Enhanced
- **Key Changes Today:**
  - Load comments automatically on mount; open modal no longer triggers load.
  - Auto-load replies per top-level comment (subscribe once per comment).
  - Preserve existing replies when top-level comments update (e.g., reacting), to prevent reply list flicker/disappear:
    - Merge strategy keeps optimistic replies and replaces only fetched items.
  - Initialize per-user reaction state (`userReaction`) for comments and replies from `userReactions` map.
  - Reaction UI improvements:
    - Buttons show the selected emoji for the current user.
    - Counts reflect the sum of saved reactions; post and comment totals hide when 0.
  - Removed stray logs and ensured cleanup of listeners on unmount.
